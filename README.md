# Next.js Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-nextjs-project.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-nextjs-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you prefer using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `.next` folder with optimized assets.

To run the built project, use:

```bash
npm run start
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

By default, it will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing

If you have tests set up, you can run them using:

```bash
npm run test
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```
